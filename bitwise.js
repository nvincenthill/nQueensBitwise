// Dissecting Ruan Pethiyagoda's bitwise solution from Twitter

// Bitwise AND ---  a & b Returns a 1 in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are 1's.
// Bitwise OR --- a | b Returns a 1 in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of either or both operands are 1's.
// Bitwise XOR ---  a ^ b Returns a 1 in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of either but not both operands are 1's.
// Bitwise NOT ---  ~ a Inverts the bits of its operand.
// Left shift ---   a << b  Shifts a in binary representation b (< 32) bits to the left, shifting in 0's from the right.
// Sign-propagating right shift --- a >> b  Shifts a in binary representation b (< 32) bits to the right, discarding bits shifted off.
// Zero-fill right shift ---  a >>> b Shifts a in binary representation b (< 32) bits to the right, discarding bits shifted off, and shifting in 0's from the left.

// Q is the size of a board side/number of queens we must place on the board but later becomes the binary representation of a full board
// u, ee, and n are each a number that is the bit pattern to what left diagonals, columns, and right diagonals are being currently attacked by queens on the board
// s maintains the count of the number of solutions found
// H is a bit pattern that represents all a board
// R is the bit pattern of the right most possible position to place a queen

// example invocation --- N(15);
